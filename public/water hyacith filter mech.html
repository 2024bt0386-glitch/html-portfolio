<h1>Mechanism of Microplastic Removal by Water Hyacinth</h1>

<p>Water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) removes microplastics primarily through root adsorption,
      achieving 55-78% efficiency for 0.5-2 μm polystyrene particles within 48 hours to 5 days, with
       adsorption dominating over minimal absorption (22-105 times higher).</p>


<h2>Root-Specific Adsorption Process</h2>

<p>The roots feature extremely dense lateral roots and abundant root caps with a total surface area
exceeding 150,000 mm² per plant, serving as primary entrapment sites for microplastics via physical 
adhesion to mucilage-covered surfaces and root hairs.</p>

<p>Fluorescence microscopy confirms microplastics accumulate on root caps, where microscopic structures
like rhizoids and sloughing epidermal cells enhance particle capture through Van der Waals forces
and electrostatic interactions, preventing free movement in water.</p>

<p>Quantitative assays show adsorption capacities of 1,060-1,426 μg/g fresh weight for different sizes,
with smaller particles (0.5 μm) showing slightly lower rates due to diffusion limits but overall rapid
surface trapping.</p>


<h2>Anatomical Barriers and Resilience</h2>

<p>A unique "vascular ring" in the stem blocks microplastic translocation to aerial tissues, confining
particles to roots and preserving leaves for safe harvesting or secondary uses like biogas.This structure,
combined with root cap renewal (constant sloughing), maintains plant health without physiological stress, 
enabling sustained remediation in contaminated waters up to 50 mg/L. Overall, the mechanism leverages 
passive physical filtration over active uptake, making water hyacinth resilient and scalable for phytoremediation.</p>


<h2>Quantitative Removal Efficiency</h2>

<p>Water hyacinth achieves rapid microplastic removal, with 48-hour efficiencies of 55.3% for 0.5 μm, 69.1% for
1 μm, and 68.8% for 2 μm polystyrene particles at 50 mg/L concentration, rising to 62.8%, 78.3%, and 76.8%
after 5 days across seven replicates. Adsorption dominates, contributing 1,060–1,426 μg/g fresh root weight, 
while absorption remains minimal (22–105 times lower), confirmed by fluorescence assays separating surface elution
from internal homogenization. Smaller particles show slightly lower rates due to diffusion barriers but consistent 
surface trapping, outperforming prior studies like Yang et al.'s 66.4% for 20 nm and 44.7% for 200 nm nanoparticles.</p>


<h2>Microstructural Root Features</h2>
<p>Roots develop extremely dense lateral roots (surface area >150,000 mm²/plant) covered in mucilage, root hairs,
and rhizoids, enabling physical entrapment via Van der Waals forces, electrostatic adhesion, and mechanical
sieving on sloughing epidermal cells. Fluorescence microscopy reveals particle accumulation exclusively on root caps,
with no translocation beyond the root endodermis due to a protective vascular ring in the stem, preserving aerial 
tissues uncontaminated. Root cap renewal through constant sloughing maintains adsorption capacity without stress,
even at high loads (50 mg/L), supporting long-term phytoremediation �.Comparative Performance AdvantagesThis passive 
mechanism leverages natural resilience, enabling dual use: roots for remediation, leaves for biogas/feed, unlike
chemical filters.</p>
