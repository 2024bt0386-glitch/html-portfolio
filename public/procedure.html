<h1>Commercial Production Procedure</h1>



<h2>Step 1: Raw Material Preparation</h2>
 <p> Harvest mature water hyacinth plants from uncontaminated sources, separate roots (high adsorption sites)
   from aerial parts, wash thoroughly, and dry at 60°C for 48 hours to yield fibrous biomass. Grind dried roots 
   into powder (0.5-2 mm particles) using industrial mills; yield targets 500 kg/hour per processing line.</p>


 <h2>Step 2: Filter Layer Fabrication</h2>
 <p>Compress root powder into rigid outer frames (e.g., 30x30 cm panels, 5 cm thick) at 10 MPa pressure with 
  natural binders like starch (10% w/w) for structural integrity.Form middle "matting" layer by felting root 
  fibers into non-woven mats (2-3 mm thick, 200 g/m² density) via needle-punching machines, mimicking artificial
   root structures for passive microplastic entrapment �.Dry aerial parts into porous "fruit-like" compartments
    (hollow spheres or pods, 1-2 cm diameter) using extrusion molding with alginate binders; these provide
     high-surface-area adsorption pockets. </p> 


 <h2>Step 3: Multi-Layer Assembly</h2>
 <p>Stack layers in sequence: rigid root-structure frames as outer housing, central root-fiber matting for primary
   trapping, and embedded dry aerial pods in the core for secondary adsorption. Secure with biodegradable clips or
    starch adhesives; automate via conveyor assembly lines producing 1000 units/hour.</p>


 <h2>Step 4: Quality Control and Testing</h2>
 <p>Test prototypes in flow-through systems (1-5 L/min) spiked with 50 mg/L polystyrene microplastics; verify
  >70% removal via fluorescence microscopy and sieving. Ensure biodegradability (>90% in 90 days per ASTM D6400)
   and scalability for wastewater plants.</p>


 <h2>>Step 5: Packaging and Scaling</h2>
 <p>Vacuum-seal units in compostable films; deploy in modular cartridges for rivers or treatment facilities.
   Commercial scaling involves 10-ton biomass dryers and robotic assembly, reducing costs to $0.50/unit at
    1M units/year while minimizing environmental impact.</p>
